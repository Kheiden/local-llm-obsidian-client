Credit: NASA, ESA, CSA, STSCI\nLaunched in 2021 on Christmas Day, the James Webb Space Telescope is the most complex, precise and powerful space observatory ever built.\n\nThe telescope's unrivaled resolution and sophistication are due in no small part to the many cutting-edge devices it contains, including a guidance camera and a scientific instrument developed by researchers at Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al's Institut de recherche sur les exoplan\u00e8tes (iREx).\n\nNow these same scientists, under the direction of Ren\u00e9 Doyon, a professor in UdeM's Department of Physics, can see the fruit of their efforts and expertise, as initial data captured by the telescope has been made public.\n\nThe first photo taken by James Webb was released by U.S. President Joe Biden on July 11, 2022, and is of unprecedented color and clarity. It is the deepest, sharpest infrared image yet taken of the distant universe: A cluster of galaxies formed over 13 billion years ago.\n\nFour more images were then unveiled live on July 12 from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. The images showed the Carina and Southern Ring nebulae in unparalleled sharpness, in addition to Stephan's Quintet, a visual grouping of five galaxies.\n\nJames Webb's first-ever spectroscopy of the exoplanet WASP-96 b, located 1,000 light-years from Earth, was also made public.

The Hubble telescope looked mainly at visible light, but James Webb looks into the infrared, enabling us to detect different phenomena.\n\nFor example, nebulae are somewhat mysterious objects because they are very dusty; there is a lot of gas blocking visible light. However, with infrared, we can penetrate the dust and obtain images like those of the Southern Ring and Carina nebulae.\n\nCredit: University of Montreal\nAre the photos the result of some kind of manipulation?\n\nYes, and the team that produced the images for the unveiling is amazing. Remember, it's not an easy task to make invisible light visible. It required the work of artists and scientists who were able to translate infrared into the colors we can see. And the colors are not chosen at random: they serve to emphasize certain scientific and artistic aspects of the objects.\n\nWhat will astrophysicists be able to do with the photos unveiled today?\nThere's still a lot of analysis to be done.

This is the biggest Canadian program for the first year, and is led by Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al Ph.D. student Olivia Lim. As with the exoplanet presented today, Olivia will be looking at the atmosphere of these exoplanets, which are rocky and could therefore resemble the Earth.
